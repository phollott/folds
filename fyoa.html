<p>This writing sample combines the <em>Custom Directives</em> feature, which AngularJS borrows from the W3C Web Components 
specification, with jsFiddle to show how an author could easily create a short story in the form of a classic 
"Choose Your Own Adventure". What is important here is that:
<ol>
  <li>If you look at the "HTML" tab, these are not regular HTML tags. Custom Directives allows me to create my own tags called Choose and Aside;</li>
  <li>Because this sample is hosted on jsFiddle and GitHub, if you want to change the story, you can fork it and change the ending;</li>
  <li>When Web Components is built into Firefox and Chrome browsers, the web is going to get a lot more exciting.</li>
  </ol>
</p>

<p>Click "Result" or "Edit in jsFiddle" to view demonstrator. </p>

<p>The original World-Wide Web was successful for a variety of reasons. A critical success factor was the "View Page Source" 
feature, which was provided by the first web browsers. This allowed developers and enthusiasts to self-educate and share code.
This viral effect which contributed to early traction. One of the things I loved about the OLPC laptop, for instance, is a
button that allows me to drop out of whatver I am currently doing and see the underlying Python code. Because of the way that 
JavaScript is included in HTML pages, the script portion of a page has historically been harder to see than the HTML. This 
difficulty increased with the advent of higher order libraries like JQuery and Prototype, but now, libraries can easily be hosted
on GitHub and Google's Content Distribution Network (CDN), making it easy once again to open the hood and see what is happpening.</p>

<p>Essentially, "Fork me on GitHub" is the "View Page Source" for the next iteration of the World-Wide Web.</p>

<p>Web 2.0 emerged as a combination of several new platforms and approaches, like 'blogging, folksonomy 
and Ajax; however, Web 2.0 is still at its core based on a document standard, HTML. With the release of HTML5 
and the upcoming Web Components specification, the W3C and the modern browsers that implement these specifications
are moving beyond the document paradigm to produce a proper application platform. Mozilla Brick and Google Polymer
promise great things, but they are going to need to find the support of a developer community.</p>
