             <h1>Beginning...</h1>

            <p>Your friend's house <i>is</i> still many miles away, and the rain is falling harder as each moment passes. You could wait in the car and listen to the radio, and perhaps the storm would let up.</p>
            <p>The sky splits into two skies as it opens up in lighting sheets, lighting first itself and then the ground, and it seems that the sky divides but increases in size with each flash.</p>
            <aside>Can sounds actually be deafening?</aside>
            <p>Please note in this example how tools like jsFiddle and github allow you to "view source", to dig deeper into the fibre of the content. The templating library used here, AngularJS, allows you to create new tags, so beyond "p" and "section", you can see "aside" and "choose" tags</p>

            <p>You get out of the car, and start to walk down the lonely highway. It is a while, but soon you see a gas station nearby. It looks like it might be deserted. It is hard to tell.</p>
            <p>The storm has lessened now, and the clouds have abandoned the moon to prying eyes. The moon is white and very cold in the evening sky in the wake of the storm.</p>
            <p>When the storm has passed, never forget, you may be still in its eye. The storm is not blind; the storm has one eye.</p>

            <p>As you approach the gas station, you realize that it probably is deserted. You cannot see anyone inside, and all of the lights are off. Maybe this is because of the thunderstorm. But, at least you might find some shelter there from the driving rain.</p>
            <p>As you hide from the rain under the shelter of the gas station, you look around, and you spy a telephone. Perhaps you could make a call?</p>
            <p>Who will you call? And what are the odds... this abandoned filling station, miles from anywhere, miles from <i>nowhere</i>. Will you even hear a ring tone?</p>

            <p>The next day you go back to pick up your car. It would have been a very long walk in the rain if you had not found that gas station.</p>
