<!-- main body of the explication-->
<p>Written in July 2006, The Pig and the Box is a book about the negative sides of DRM, written as a reaction to Access Copyright's Captain Copyright campaign directed at kids. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pig_and_the_Box">[Wikipedia]</a>

</p>
<p>The text itself is now available through Creative Commons, so I thought it would be entirely appropriate to turn it into a "mad lib", using my technologies of choice, AngularJS, a somewhat magical Javascript framework developed by a team at Google, and jsFiddle, a pastebin that operates on some of the same principles as Github.</p>
<p>What is important about the original text is both the message and the medium. There is clearly a statement here about interrogating copyright, and challenging our own assumptions about fairness of use; but more than this, this is an internet text, written through, within and about the internet; originally available through print on demand, now remixed and mashed up.</p>
<p>I think what is important about my example is the way that jsFiddle allows you to easily "view source" the HTML, Javascript, and CSS that was used to create the example, which you can tweak, fork, and reuse to your heart's content. This reveals the intersection between narrative, technology and presentation; content and context.</p>
